# EDA: Student Performance Indicator

Problem Statement

This project investigates how students' performance (test scores) is influenced by variables such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch, and test preparation courses.

Data Collection

Source: Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams

The dataset contains 8 columns and 1000 rows.


Dataset Information

Gender: Sex of students (Male/Female)

Race/Ethnicity: Group A, B, C, D, or E

Parental Level of Education: Final education of parents (e.g., bachelor's degree, some college)

Lunch: Type of lunch before the test (standard/free or reduced)

Test Preparation Course: Completed or not before the test

Math Score: Math test score

Reading Score: Reading test score

Writing Score: Writing test score


Project Goals

1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.


2. Examine relationships between test scores and categorical variables.


3. Generate visualizations to represent the findings effectively.



Steps in Analysis

1. Data loading and inspection


2. Data cleaning and preprocessing


3. Data exploration and feature analysis


4. Insights and visualizations


5. Conclusion and recommendations



Dependencies

Python 3.x

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn


Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>


2. Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the notebook:

jupyter notebook


4. Open 2.0-Student Performance EDA.ipynb and execute the cells sequentially.



Insights and Observations

There are no missing or duplicate values in the dataset.

Average test scores are consistent across subjects, with a mean of approximately 66-69.

Key factors like test preparation and parental education significantly influence performance.
