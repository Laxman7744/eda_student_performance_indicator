# 📊 Student Performance - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing student performance using a real-world dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that impact academic outcomes and to derive actionable insights through data visualization and statistical analysis.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze the dataset and explore:
- How various factors like subject scores, demographics, and other features relate to overall student performance.
- Correlations and distributions between different variables.
- Statistical summaries and outlier analysis.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Key Steps Performed

- ✅ Data Loading using `pandas.read_excel()`
- ✅ Data Cleaning and Null Value Handling
- ✅ Descriptive Statistics
- ✅ Data Visualization (Bar plots, Histograms, Boxplots, etc.)
- ✅ Correlation Matrix & Heatmap
- ✅ Insights and Summary

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

> *(Add screenshots or sample plots here by uploading images to your repo and linking them)*

---

## 📚 Dataset Information

- Source: *(Specify source if available, e.g., UCI, Kaggle, etc.)*
- Format: Excel `.xlsx` file
- Columns: *(e.g., Date, Temperature, RH, Wind Speed, etc.)*

---

## 🔍 Insights

- Example: Higher wind speeds correlated with increased forest fire risk.
- Example: Temperature and RH (Relative Humidity) showed inverse relationships.
*(Modify these based on the actual insights you found in your EDA)*
